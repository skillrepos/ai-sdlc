These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the code. 

**1. Click on the button below to start a new codespace from this repository.**

Click here ➡️  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/skillrepos/ai-sdlc?quickstart=1)

**2. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

This will run for a long time (10 or more minutes) while it gets everything ready.

After the initial startup, it will run a script to setup the python environment and install needed python pieces, . This will take several more minutes to run. It will look like this while this is running.

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

3. **You'll want to have the labs.md file open (either in a browser tab and/or in your codespace).**

4. **Now, you are ready for the labs!**

**4. (Optional, but recommended) Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to longer (60 for half-day sessions, 90 for deep dive sessions).**
To do this, when logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and scroll down on that page until you see the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.
