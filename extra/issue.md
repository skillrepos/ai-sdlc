Issue Description ## Summary Add a new search endpoint to our to-do API that allows clients to query items by a substring of their name (case-insensitive). ⸻ ## Motivation Currently we only support listing all items (GET /items). Lab 2 requires demonstrating how to extend an existing REST service with a new feature. A “search” endpoint is a simple, concrete example that exercises both routing in app.py and logic in datastore.py. ⸻ ## Acceptance Criteria • A new route GET /items/search?q= is exposed and protected by the existing @requires_auth decorator. • When q is omitted or empty, it returns all items. • When q is provided, only items whose "name" contains the lowercase form of are returned. • Returns HTTP 200 with a JSON array of matching item objects, each with id and name fields. • Includes unit tests for the DataStore.search() method covering matches, no-matches, and empty query. • Includes integration tests for the new endpoint, covering authorized success, empty-query behavior, and unauthorized access (401). ## Example Usage # List all items (search with empty query) curl -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token" \ "http://localhost:5000/items/search" # Search for “milk” (case‐insensitive) curl -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token" \ "http://localhost:5000/items/search?q=Milk"
